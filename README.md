# ✉️ Email Spam Detection For ISP

# Project Overview
In today's digital world, email spam is more than just a nuisance—it's a security risk and a productivity drain. This project focuses on improving our existing email filtering system by harnessing the power of supervised machine learning.

Using a dataset containing a mix of spam and non-spam emails, I developed two classification models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest. These models are designed to automatically and accurately identify spam emails, preventing them from cluttering inboxes.

By comparing the performance of these models, we will determine which approach is best suited to enhance our spam filtering system and improve email management for our users.
